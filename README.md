**Part B — Implementation of 6 Design Patterns from GL (60 points)**

According to the slides, there are only 5 design patterns. So, I will only be talking about the 5 discussed on the slides.

**1. Navigation - Top Navigation Menu**

   Before:
   
   <img width="1881" height="935" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f915e29-f597-4df3-9501-bdb1406f4bf7" />
   
   After:
   
   <img width="1884" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d1e4f51-87ef-4cb2-ba6e-4eaecbfda000" />

   I implemented navigation design pattern in the form of a top navigation menu. Navigation design pattern fits my feature because a top navigation menu helps users move from page to page by providing a             predictable and consistent header bar. It solves the HCI problem that users sometimes get lost and need extra steps to just move among core pages. The expected user improvement is faster movement between         key pages, increasing efficiency.


**2. Input & Forms - Dark-Mode Toggle Button**

   Before:
   
   <img width="1884" height="928" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/618bed61-ea0b-4eb7-8002-5d2e549a8d26" />
   
   After:
   
   <img width="1886" height="949" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dba6cdc-5896-4446-ba0b-429dbdc981e4" />

   I implemented an input and forms design pattern in the form of a dark mode toggle button. An input and forms pattern fits my feature because the toggle functions as a simple binary input that lets users          easily choose between light and dark themes. It solves the HCI problem where users with different lighting conditions or visual preferences need control over contrast without navigating into deeper               settings. The expected user improvement is quicker theme adjustment, which increases comfort and reduces visual strain.



**3. Feedback & Status - Hover Effects and Highlight**

   Before:
   
   <img width="512" height="80" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b828287-431d-468b-b2b0-b98caa838615" />
   
   After:
   
   <img width="493" height="83" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ed4444-f081-4b6e-9b06-d398e3c6bad1" />

   I implemented a feedback and status design pattern in the form of navigation links that highlight when selected or hovered. A feedback and status pattern fits my feature because these visual changes act as       immediate system responses that confirm where the user is and what element is interactive. It solves the HCI problem where users may be unsure about their current location or whether an item can be clicked.      The expected user improvement is clearer orientation and reduced uncertainty, which leads to smoother and more confident navigation.



**4. Layout & Structure - Three-Column Card Grid**

   Before:
   No layout & structure patterns would result in the elements within the page to be different (for example, spacing and fonts).
   
   After:
   
   <img width="1882" height="936" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbcd7d94-6938-4cb6-91d8-f1ac2397c918" />

   I implemented a layout and structure design pattern in the form of a three-column card grid. A layout and structure pattern fits my feature because the grid organizes each service into uniform cards that         follow a consistent visual hierarchy. It solves the HCI problem where unstructured information forces users to spend extra time scanning and comparing content. The expected user improvement is faster             recognition of each service and easier visual parsing, which increases efficiency.



   **5. Data Presentation - Service Card Data**
   
   Before:
   With no data presentation patterns, the service cards would lose their structured format, so titles and descriptions might appear as a plain text block with no visual hierarchy. Nothing would separates or        highlight key information.

   After:
   
   <img width="939" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7da31c4-0bcd-4778-a87a-aefe71c50dd2" />

   I implemented a data presentation design pattern in the form of structured service cards. A data presentation pattern fits my feature because each card arranges the title and short description into a clear       hierarchy that supports quick scanning. It solves the HCI problem where users waste time interpreting unstructured text with no visual cues. The expected user improvement is quicker understanding of each         service and reduced cognitive load when comparing options.





**Part C — Evaluation Plan (similar to Week 10 assignment) (20 points)**
